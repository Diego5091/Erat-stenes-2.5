# üåç Eratosthenes 2.5 (2025)
---

##  Objective

To scientifically test and evaluate the shape of the Earth by measuring solar shadows in different geographic locations. This experiment aims to either validate the spherical Earth model or challenge it through direct observation, using modern tools to replicate Eratosthenes' method and examine flat Earth claims with measurable data.



##  Materials Required

Each participant must have:

- **Metal rod (exactly 100 cm)**  
- **Bubble level** (to ensure the rod is perfectly vertical)  
- **Tape measure or ruler** (with millimeter precision)  
- **Smartphone or GPS device** to collect:
  - Latitude
  - Longitude
  - Altitude above sea level  
- **Weather app or device** to record:
  - Temperature (¬∞C)
  - Humidity (%)
  - Atmospheric pressure (hPa)
- **Clock synchronized to UTC UNIVERSAL **
- **Camera or phone** to take pictures of the setup and the shadow

##  Suggested Apps

To make accurate measurements and calculations:

-  **GPS Coordinates** ‚Üí [GPS Coordinates App (Android/iOS) Google.maps]  
-  **Solar Noon Time** ‚Üí [SunCalc.net](https://www.suncalc.org/)
-  **Weather App** ‚Üí AccuWeather, Weather.com, or your local meteorological source
-  **bubble level App** ‚Üí [AccuWeather, Weather.com, or your local meteorological source apple](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/measure/id1383426740) ,
-  **bubble level App documentation** ‚Üí ( https://support.apple.com/en-us/102468) 



##  Instructions for Measurement

1. **Choose a day** with clear skies around **solar noon** in your area.
2. **Place the metal rod vertically** on a flat, level surface using a bubble level.
3. Wait for the **exact moment of solar noon**.
4. Measure the **length of the shadow** (from the base of the rod to the tip of the shadow).
5. Record the following:
   - **Date** and **UTC time**
   - **City/location**
   - **Latitude & Longitude** (in decimal format)
   - **Altitude (m above sea level)**
   - **Rod length (in cm)**
   - **Shadow length (in cm)**
   - **Shadow direction** (azimuth, using compass app) ( what is azimuth  = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dd9lrKUKHW0)
   - **Temperature, Humidity, and Pressure**
6. **Take pictures** of your setup and the shadow
7. Enter your data in the shared CSV file:  
   `/data/measurements.csv`



## Notes & Common Pitfalls

- The rod must be **perfectly vertical**. Use a **bubble level** to avoid errors.
- The surface should be **flat** and not tilted in any direction.
- Be precise with your **shadow measurement**: measure at the moment when the shadow is shortest (solar noon).
- Use **UTC time** to ensure consistency across all locations.
- Measure in **centimeters and meters**, not inches or feet.
- Record all GPS data with at least **5 decimal points** for precision.
- Avoid cloudy or hazy days, as it can **blur the shadow** or shift its position.
- Do not round measurements too early. **Use exact values** during recording.



## Where to Upload Data

- Submit your measurements by editing `measurements.csv` located in the `/data/` folder.
- Upload your photos inside the `/docs/images/` folder.
- Optionally, add your name and city as contributors in the `paper.md`.
